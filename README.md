## About

Hi, welcome to my portfolio

I'm Oluwaseun! I have a technical background and currently hold a degree in Civil engineering (B.Eng). I have developed a strong foundation in construction management and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to utilize my technical and analytical skills as an entry-level data analyst. 

I have experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, clean, organize, analyze, and visualize data to empower decision making and drive changes. I am proficient in SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python. I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data mining, data merging, statistics, and critical thinking.

My name is Sean, I am a data analyst with experience using various data tools to clean, analyze, and visualize data to empower decision making and drive changes. I am proficient in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python, and have a good understanding of data analytics techniques including, but not limited to, data preparation, data wrangling, statistical analysis, charts design, dashboard building, process documenting, and data storytelling.

In this portfolio, I have included data projects that showcase my technical skills as well as analytical capability. You will find documents, workbooks, presentation slides, and dashboards created with SQL, Tableau, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, and PowerPoint. These projects demonstrate my ability to organize, analyze, and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for anyone to understand and make informed decisions.

 I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
