# Oluwaseun Oladimeji - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, welcome to my portfolio

I'm Oluwaseun! I have a technical background and currently hold a degree in Civil engineering (B.Eng). I have developed a strong foundation in construction management and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to utilize my technical and analytical skills as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
